# Download Trained Model

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the trained model is hosted on Google Drive. Please follow these steps to use the model:

1. Download the trained model from this link: [AI Code Documentation Generator - Trained Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CzCgIwzT88KW9W4gIOQ89hJWM06TlrPP?usp=sharing)

2. Create a folder named `trained_model` in the `app` directory of the project:
```bash
mkdir app/trained_model
```

3. Extract the downloaded model files into the `app/trained_model` directory

The final structure should look like:
```
app/
├── trained_model/
├── app.py
└── DOWNLOAD_MODEL.md
```

Note: Make sure all model files are properly placed in the trained_model directory before running the application.
